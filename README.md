# genomics-final-project

All the scripts used for my groups BIOL469: Genomics final project in the University of Waterloo. 

* Around ~300 Pseudomonas strains that are known to interact with plants, beneficially or pathogenically, were identified.
* The raw genomes of the strains were downloaded, and ran through prokka and UniProt.
* The UniProt proteins were assigned to Gene Ontology (GO) terms.
* The GO terms were scored based on their frequencies in each Pseudomonas genome.
* The top GO terms, and the overall trends of the expressions of the GO terms were analyzed to see if some GO terms can be used to identify future pathogenic or beneficial bacteria.
